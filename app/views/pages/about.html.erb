          <h3>6% Breakdown</h3>
          <p>Why 6% on each sale? We pay 3% on each sale for credit card services from Stripe and the remaining 3% goes to Echtchange for continuing improvements and expansion of services. </p>

          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>We found none of the current solutions for selling books really worked in a way that connected students locally and made it easy for them to trade books. We sought to change this and Echtchange was born.</p>
